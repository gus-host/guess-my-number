# Guess My Number Game
This is a simple number guessing game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user is required to guess a number between 1 and 20, and the game will provide feedback based on the guess.

## How to Play

2. The game interface will display a header with the title "Guess My Number!" and a message indicating the range of numbers to guess between.
3. Enter your guess into the input field provided and click the "Check!" button.
4. Based on your guess, you will receive feedback:
- If your guess is correct, you win! The background color will change, and you'll receive a congratulatory message.
- If your guess is too high or too low, you'll receive hints to help you refine your guess.

5. The game keeps track of your score and displays it along with the highscore.
7. Click the "Again!" button to play another round. The game will reset, and you can make a new guess.
